# UFOs 
## Overview 
This data visualization project was created to help raise awareness of the pervasiveness of UFO sightings. An interactive website was created to allow the public to search though the sightings data by filtering it. The filter for the initial version of the website was based on the date of the occurance. The user would key the date of interest then click the "Filter Table" button to retrieve the results. The screen could then be refreshed by clicking on "UFO Sightings" in the upper left corner of the site window to perform a new search.

The updated version of the site allowed for filtering by date, city, state, country or shape in any combination of one or multiple items to retrieve the desired results. The filtering options of the new site were great, but the site appearance was not very captivating so enhancements were made as follows:
- Animation was added to allow the a seven second fade-in for the jumbotron element. 
- A YouTube video of a clip from the pentagon that was broadcast by the Today show was added for additional interest.

## Summary
The new website is great, but there are some shortcomings:
- The source data is not current.
- The filter term(s) must be exact to retrieve the results.
- Default filters are not necessary.
## Recommendations
Recommendations for improvement include:
- Obtain current data.
- Update filters to use fuzzy logic for filter functions.
- Remove default filters.
